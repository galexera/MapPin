# MapPin
MapPin is a website where users can pinpoint locations on Map of places they've visited or they plan to visit also they can add a review,
describe and rate their experience which will help others to plan their itinerary better.
I've used the MERN stack for developing this application, MongoDB maintains the collection of each place marked and the user details.
